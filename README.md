CRUD With Data Access Object (DAO)

Virtually all applications today require access to at least one data source, 
these sources are generally relational databases, so many times we have no 
problem accessing the data, however, there are times when those that we need 
to have more than one data source or the data source that we have may vary, 
which would force us to refactor much of the code. For this, we have the 
Architectural Data Access Object (DAO) pattern, which allows separating the 
data access logic from the Business Objects or Business Objects, in such a 
way that the DAO encapsulates all the data access logic to the rest of the application.

I did this example with a form registration system using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, 
and Delete), which are basic functions of databases or the persistence layer of all software.
